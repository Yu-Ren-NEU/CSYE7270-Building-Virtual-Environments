# Animation

I create three types of animations.

1. Simple Animation. One animation must include movement but does not require a rig.
2. Sprite Sheet Animation. Create a sprite sheet. Animate or create a flip-book must have a set of at least 30 sprites, and translate and rotate a game character. I create a firework animation including 32 sprites, and it will transform and rotate in the duration of movement.
3. Cycle Animation. Animate a movement cycle such as a walk cycle, fly cycle, kick cycle, etc using your sprite sheet in a game. First and last frame must be the same. In this part, I create seven animations which includes Shake Head, Jump, Swing, Attack, Spike, Rush and Death.
