# Endless Runner

I add Five signification feature enhancements in Endless Runner.

1. Add a prop, so that the character can destroy the blockers.
2. Add timer for props' effective time.
3. The character can crouch to pass through specific terrain.
4. Store the record of the game to improve game experience.
5. With the progress of the game, change the speed of the character to increase the difficulty.

I write the explaination of code and design in "Code and Design Explaination.pdf".
