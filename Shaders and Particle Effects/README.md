# Shaders and Particle Effects

I create two shaders and two particle-effects for my final project.

1. The water shader has opacity, ambient, specular effects, random effects and animation.
2. The Dissolve shader has fresnel and noise.
3. The Fire particle effect. The opacity and color are adjustable. And it uses a custom material.
4. The Lightning Tree particle effect. It has a trailing effect and has a form of explosion. It also uses a custom material.
